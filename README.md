# OFFICER CAP

A discord bot that yells at you if you don't type in all caps

## Getting started

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Running locally

```
nodemon
```

This will setup local server and listen to changes you make and automatically update. Next do

```

and copy the Forwarding url to the 'INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT URL' section of the Discord bot settings. This will forward traffic to localhost.
